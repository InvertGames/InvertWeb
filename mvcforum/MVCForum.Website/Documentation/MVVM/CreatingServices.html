<h1>Creating Services</h1><h2>Create a project and open it in Graph Designer</h2><p>You need to create a new project to begin this journey.
</p><p>Navigate to the project window and create a folder. Pick up the name to correspond your project: 
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/gV6dWD0.png' /></div><p>From here right click on the newly created folder and choose uFrame->New Project
</p><p>This will create a new project repository for you. You will find it inside of the folder.The project repository will hold references to all of your graphs.
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/yv6J4Ag.png' /></div><p>Change your project name by renaming the project repository file. You can pick up the same name, you have chosen for the folder:
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/YTf2p2G.png' /></div><br/><p>If you haven't already, open the graph designer by clicking on Window->uFrame Designer in the Unity menu.
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/80Pou12.png' /></div><p>Finally you need to select your project in graph designer.
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/K7rf60I.png' /></div><h2>Create a 'Element' node with the name 'Game'</h2><p>In this step you need to create Element.</p><p>To create any kind of node you need to right click on an empty space on the graph. Context menu will appear. It will contain different 'Add' commands. Each 'Add' commandallows you to add a new node to the graph. The types of nodes you can create may be different based on the context. For example, you can create elements only inside of subsystems, and you can only create views inside of elements.
</p><br/><a href='Element.html' target='content-frame'>Element</a>
<h2>Create a 'View' node with the name 'GameView'</h2><p>In this step you need to create View.</p><p>To create any kind of node you need to right click on an empty space on the graph. Context menu will appear. It will contain different 'Add' commands. Each 'Add' commandallows you to add a new node to the graph. The types of nodes you can create may be different based on the context. For example, you can create elements only inside of subsystems, and you can only create views inside of elements.
</p><p>You must enter the 'Game' element context to create its view, you can do this by double-clicking on it.
</p><br/><a href='ElementViews.html' target='content-frame'>Element Views</a>
<h2>Create a connection from Game output to GameView element input.</h2><p>In this step you are going to create a connection from Game output to GameView element input.
First of all you need to locate . If it is a node, expand it. When you place your mouse pointer over the , input and output connectors will be shown.Then you need to locate . If it is a node, expand it. When you place your mouse pointer over the , input and output connectors will be shown.Both nodes and items MAY have inputs and outputs</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/YTSnk19.png' /></div><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/1y5mvRb.png' /></div><p>Left-click on the Game output, hold left mouse button and drag it to GameView element input. Then release left mouse button. This should create a connection between Game output and GameView element input</p><h2>Create a new Service Graph with the name 'DebugService'</h2><p>In this step you will learn a little bit about graphs.Each graph lives physically as a file inside your project folder. Graphs are combined into a uFrame project, but they can live on their own and can be linked to different projects at once!
</p><p>Each graph can contain nodes of certain types. Graphs can also share nodes between each other as long as they belong to the same project.Graphs are used to manage various sections of your project. 
</p><p>You can create graphs using uFrame Graph Designer Window. In the top left corner you will find graph selection box. Besides displaying all the graphs attached to the current project, it will show options to create new graphs of different types
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/MqXxE6h.png' /></div><div class='note'><b>Note: </b>When you create a graph, pay attention to what project is currently selected! Graph will be created and linked to the selected project automatically. Also, graph file will be created inside of the selected project folder.</div><p>In this step we need to create a graph of type ServiceGraph</p><p>After you create a graph, it will contain only one node. This node represents graph itself and is often called Graph node.
</p><p>To rename your graph, you have to rename the corresponding graph node. For this, you have to right-click on the header of the graph node and click rename.Node title will become editable. Type in the desired title. Click anywhere else, to finish editing
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/PDUZhsU.png' /></div><div class='note'><b>Note: </b>When user renames graph node, uFrame automatically updates graph file too!</div><h2>Create a 'SimpleClass' node with the name 'LogEvent'</h2><p>In this step you need to create SimpleClass.</p><p>To create any kind of node you need to right click on an empty space on the graph. Context menu will appear. It will contain different 'Add' commands. Each 'Add' commandallows you to add a new node to the graph. The types of nodes you can create may be different based on the context. For example, you can create elements only inside of subsystems, and you can only create views inside of elements.
</p><br/><a href='SimpleClasses.html' target='content-frame'>Simple Classes</a>
<h2>Create a property with the name 'Message' on 'LogEvent' node</h2><p>In this step you will need to create and item called "Message" in the "Properties" section of LogEvent node. Just like any other item, it will belong to a node. That is why you first need to locate the corresponding node: LogEvent. The next step is to locate the corresponding section. Most of the time section has a clear name. In this case, section is called "Properties"
Almost every section will have a plus button to the right. By clicking this button, you introduce a new entry in the section. Most of time, clicking this button will instantly add a new entry in the section. However, some of them will show selection window, and you will need to select an item from the list.</p><p>The final step is specifying name and optional type for the item. This is not always necessary.To rename an item, you have to double click it's name. If it is not a reference item, the name will become editable. To finish editing, click anywhere else on the graph.
Some items may allow you to specify type. To select type, click on the current type of the item. Type selection window will appear. Select desired type from the list.
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/EzVOszn.png' /></div><div class='note'><b>Note: </b>Not every item has a type. </div><div class='note'><b>Note: </b>Some items represent a reference to another item. That is why you cannot modify it's name directly.</div><br/><h2>Create a handler with the name 'LogEvent' on 'DebugService' node</h2><p>In this step you will need to create and item called "LogEvent" in the "Handlers" section of DebugService node. Just like any other item, it will belong to a node. That is why you first need to locate the corresponding node: DebugService. The next step is to locate the corresponding section. Most of the time section has a clear name. In this case, section is called "Handlers"

Just like any other item, it will belong to a node. That is why you first need to locate the corresponding node: Game. The next step is to locate the corresponding section. Most of the time section has a clear name. In this case, section is called "Commands"

That is why you cannot modify it's name directly.</div><br/><h2>Save & Compile the project.</h2><p>In this step you need to initiate the process of code generation. This is done using Save and Compile button in the top right corner of the graph designer window. Saving and compiling is the process of taking the information you've created by graphs and putting it into code form.  The generated code consists of both designer files (always regenerated), and editable files (only generated if it doesnt exist so it doesn't destroy your implementations).
</p><div class='note'><b>Note: </b> It does not matter, what graph you are currently in. Save and Compile procedure is Project-specific and is performed for all the graphs in the project at once. So pay attention to what project is currently selected.</div><div class='note'><b>Note: </b> If you face with compiling issues after you save and compile, first of all, determine where the issue comes from. If it is an editable file: you can fix it manually and uFrame will not erase your fix on next code generation. If the issue comes from designer files (which gets regenerated each time), you need to understand if an issue is related to your diagram. Sometimes, type references may have invalid types, or elements may have incorrectly named properties. Such diagram issues may result into generated code not compiling.</div><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/QhfMGSq.png' /></div><h2>Scaffold Kernel</h2><p>In this step we need to scaffold/update kernel. You can read more about kernel on the kernel page.This step will modify/create the kernel of your project. This kernel is then used to load all the dependencies for your game.
</p><div class='note'><b>Note: </b>When kernel is being updated, you may get the following exception:
"InvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object"
This error is harmless and will be fixed in one of upcoming updates</div><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/349glV8.png' /></div><a href='TheKernel.html' target='content-frame'>The Kernel</a>
<h2>Open DebugService.cs and implement the LogEventHandler method.</h2><p>Right-Click on the Node and choose Open->DebugService
