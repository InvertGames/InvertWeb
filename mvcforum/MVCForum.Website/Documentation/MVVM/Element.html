<h1>Element</h1><h2>What is it?</h2><p>ViewModels are the theoretical objects in your game.  They consist of data in the form of properties and collections, and also define the available commands for that object.  Because they are regular C# classes and do not inherit from Monobehaviour, ViewModels are very portable.  Although they do not require a View in order to exist, if you would like to represent a ViewModel's data in Unity, you would create a View and bind it to that ViewModel.
</p><br/><h2>Where does it exist in Unity?</h2><p>ViewModels don't technically exist until runtime, at which point they are instantiated into memory as needed.  If a View exists in your scene, at runtime it will publish the 'ViewCreatedEvent' for the specific ViewModel it wants to bind to, at which point the ViewService will set the ViewModel with the matching given identifier, creating it if it doesn't exist.  When defining single instances of a particular ViewModel through the uFrame Editor window on a subsystem, these instances are also created at runtime and will be readily available in the SceneManager's Dependency Container for any Views requesting them.
