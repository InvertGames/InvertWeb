<h1>How It Works Together</h1><p>So if you've made games in Unity before, you may have noticed how easy it is to end up with a mess of components with heavy dependencies.  Unit testing is impossible.  Adding/removing properties or changing the game logic of one component may break components on one, two, or half a dozen other Gameobjects and/or UI elements.  It can easily become a nightmare.
</p><br/><p>In uFrame, an emphasis is placed on separating out the pieces of your game into certain categories (often referred to as "layers"), based on this hybrid MVCVM pattern.  The reasoning behind this is to help enforce separation of concerns, and allow you to quickly split things into these categories and think about them up-front.  These parts are defined as:
</p><div class='img-container'><img src='http://i.imgur.com/oVunJef.png' /></div><p> - ViewModels: The objects, including properties and available commands
</p><p> - Controllers: The rules, where you implement logic of commands
</p><p> - Views: The visual/auditory representation of your objects in a game engine environment
</p><br/><p>It gets a little more complicated with the actual implementation, but the chart above is the core concept.  Ideas are always theoretical.  The idea of your game and everything that defines it should technically be able to exist in any environment, whether it's a game engine, a console app, or a physical board game.  A player takes damage and health is decremented; this concept can be represented any number of ways, as a UI health gauge, a damage printout message in a console, or loss of health tokens from a board game player.
</p><br/><br/><p>In the previous example the Player would be a ViewModel, an object in your game, with a Health property.  There would most likely be a TakeDamage command defined in the PlayerController, which would handle the rule of decrementing the playerViewModel's Health.  When the value changes on the Health property, you may have it trigger a view binding on the PlayerHUDView which updates a health gauge according to this new value.  The fun part is that all it takes to trigger this chain of events is something like:
</p><pre><code class='csharp'>ExecuteCommand(playerVM.TakeDamage, 10); // player takes 10 damage</code></pre><p>This command can be executed from any controller, or any view that has access to that particular PlayerViewModel instance, usually through some kind of interaction, such as a collision with spikes or an enemy's weapon.  Furthermore, it is important to make a distinction of game logic (which goes on the Controller layer of the design) and visual/auditory/engine-specific logic (which belongs on the View layer).
</p><br/><p>Instead of an EnemyView detecting that it has hit the PlayerView, taking its PlayerViewModel instance, and executing the TakeDamage command on it directly from that EnemyView, it's important to make the distinction that this is game logic and belongs in the Controller layer.  The correct approach that most follows the MVCVM pattern would be to implement some kind of AttackPlayer command on the Enemy element, and pass the playerViewModel of the PlayerView that the EnemyView has hit.
</p><h3>EnemyView, Hit was detected</h3><script src="https://gist.github.com/micahosborne/2db6ead6cc89deb81a5e.js"></script><p>Now that you're handling the game logic properly on the Controller layer, the actual logic is no longer dependent on that specific view, and is available to anything that tells the EnemyViewModel to AttackPlayer.
</p><h3>Enemy and Player Controllers Command Logic</h3><script src="https://gist.github.com/micahosborne/f79b3de4126c75d5bb03.js"></script><br/><p>As you can see, there's a method to the madness.  Separating the core logic and state from the "Monobehaviour" side of things allows any number of Views to use this data.  Under the hood, uFrame manages the state and helps centralize logic.  Everything else is just an expression of that state, a Player getting attacked or taking damage and losing health.
