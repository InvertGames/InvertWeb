<h1>State Machines</h1><p>uFrame utilizes a new concept developed to fit the uFrame and RX paradigm of programming.  We like to call this "Re-active" state machines. 
</p><p>The main concept of state machines in uFrame MVVM is that when defining them in your diagrams you don't need to focus on anything other than the states and transitions that make up the machine.  Making the machine come to life is a matter of wiring them to computed properties, command bindings, and view bindings.  But initially, you can focus purely on the high-level rather than implementation, once commands and transitions are all wired together transitions and states can be easily tweaked with minimal to zero changes in your code.
</p><p>Reactive State Machines employ the concept of data subscriptions causing transitions, rather than polling data every frame, this can give a definite increase in performance.

</p><pre><code class='csharp'>{ViewModel}.{StateMachinePropertyName}Property.Transition("NAME OF TRANSITION HERE");</code></pre><br/><h2>Manually setting the state</h2><pre><code class='csharp'>{ViewModel}.{StateMachinePropertyName}Property.SetState&lt;STATE_CLASS_NAME&gt;();</code></pre><h3>or</h3><pre><code class='csharp'>{ViewModel}.{StateMachinePropertyName}Property.SetState("STATE_NAME");</code></pre><br/>
